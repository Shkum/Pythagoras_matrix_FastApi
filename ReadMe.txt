FastApi project, hosted at AWS EC2 hosting. 

The following libraries and frameworks were used: Python, FastAPI, SQLite, Jinja, HTML, CSS. Also SQLAlchemy and GoogleTranslate for creating and translating of DB.

The page is used for numerological calculation of the Pythagorean matrix. For this calculation, for the sake of my interest, I kept statistics for several years and noticed that the results of the calculation coincide in about 80% of cases. I think if I were an employer, I would take this calculation into account when applying for a job.
